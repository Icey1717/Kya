# Kya: Dark Lineage Decompilation

This repository hosts an ongoing decompilation of *Kya: Dark Lineage*, a 2003 action-adventure platformer developed by Eden Games and published by Atari for the PlayStation 2.  
The goal is to reverse-engineer the game's original C++ source code from its compiled binaries, facilitating a deeper understanding of its mechanics, enabling modding, and preserving its legacy.

## üß† Project Overview

The decompilation effort aims to reconstruct the game's source code, providing insights into its architecture and design.  
This process involves analyzing the compiled binaries to recreate human-readable and compilable source code.
